# Zephyr

A simple and beautiful weather app built with Flutter, powered by the OpenMeteo API, Qweather API and the search functionality is provided by the OpenStreetMap API.\
The backend is powered by the open-source [Zeus](https://github.com/LanceHuang245/Zeus), which aggregates service provider APIs and provides intelligent data caching, classification, and data transformation capabilities to deliver Zephyr services.

### Translation
1. The language files are located in the /lib/l10n directory.
2. You need to make a copy of `app_en.arb` and change the name of the file to the language you want to translate, e.g. `app_fr.arb`.
3. Complete the translation of the language file
4. (Mandatory) run `flutter gen-l10n` in the project root directory in a terminal and check if there are any untranslated fields in the terminal output (if there are then check `untranslated.json` and change it)
5. (Mandatory) add language in lib/core/languages.dart in the format
6. Push your code and commit [Pull Request](https://github.com/ClaretWheel1481/Zephyr/pulls)
